## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:
/SQL
├── problem1.sql
├── problem2.sql
├── problem3.sql
└── ...

- Each `.sql` file contains a SQL query for a specific LeetCode problem.
- Filenames are descriptive of the problems they address.

## Problem Categories

The SQL problems in this repository are categorized based on their type and difficulty:

- **Basic Queries**: Simple SELECT statements and basic filtering.
- **Aggregation Queries**: Problems involving aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.
- **Joins**: Problems involving inner joins, outer joins, and self-joins.
- **Subqueries**: Problems that require subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, or FROM clauses.
- **Window Functions**: Problems using window functions for ranking and cumulative calculations.

Each SQL file is named according to the problem number or a brief description.

## Query Naming Convention

- **Descriptive Names**: SQL files are named with a brief description of the problem they solve or the LeetCode problem number.
- **Aliases**: Aliases like `current` and `prev` are used in self-joins to improve readability.
