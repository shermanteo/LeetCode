## Repository Structure

The SQL repository is organized as follows:

- Name of the SQL problem with the details of the problem
- Within each problem, there will be a question as well as an example input and output to help better visualise the expected solution.
- At the end of the script, there will be a query which I write which will answer the question based on my thought process and logic.
